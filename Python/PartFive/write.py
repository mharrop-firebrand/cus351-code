#! Write to a file
# There are two different methods we can use to write to a file

# write() - this method is used to write a string to a file. It only accepts a string as the argument and for anything else, a TypeError will occur

# writelines() - we can use this method to write a list of strings to a file. This method can accept a string or a list as an argument

#! Important
# ? If this file does not exist then a new file with the specified file-name will be created and content will be added to it
# ? if a file already exists then writing to that file will truncate it. This means any existing content will be deleted and new content will be added to the file

#! writeline()
# This will write our text in example.txt


#! writelines()

# List of strings seperated by \n for new lines

# So we don't write over out example.py we'll create a new file
# This will create a file and write lines

# Verify the contents has been added
