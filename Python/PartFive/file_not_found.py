# In the case of reading, appending or deleting a file, if the file does not already exists then you will get a 'FileNotFoundError'

# We can use the 'os' module and embed an 'if' statement before reading, appending or deleting a file to check if a file exists

# Going to be found

# or

# os.remove()

# If statement for not going to be found
