#! Class without a constructor
# A class without a custom constructor will have a default constructor provided by Python.
# The purpose of this default constructor is to initialize the object's attributes.
# The default constructor is part of your source code and is present in the class's definition within your .py file.
# It doesn't contain any additional code unless you add custom initialization.
# class Car:
#     # This class has no constructor
#     def car_method(self):
#         return "Beep"


# car1 = Car()
# # print(car1.car_method())


#! Non-parameterized constructor
# A non-parameterized constructor is where no parameters are defined or needed
# Such a constructor type is used when objects are initialized with default values
# class Student:
#     # Non-parameterized constuctor
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.name = "John"

#     def introduce(self):
#         return f"Hi i am {self.name}"


# student1 = Student()

# print(student1.name)
# print(student1.introduce())


#! Parameterized constructor
# For a more dynamic functionality of creating objects and initializing instance variables with different values, a parameterized constructor is used
# The first parameter is still 'self' but you can have additional parameters and it can have any number of arguments
# We can supply different values via arguments at the time of object creation

# class Car:
#     # A parmertize constructor
#     def __init__(self, make, model, door_num, colour, year, seat_num):
#         # Initilized instance variables
#         self.make = make
#         self.model = model
#         self.door_num = door_num
#         self.colour = colour
#         self.year = year
#         self.seat_num = seat_num

#     # Method to show car information:
#     def car_info(self):
#         return f"The car is a {self.make} with the model {self.model} from the year {self.year}. It has {self.door_num} doors, it has {self.seat_num} seats and it is a {self.colour} colour."

#         if self.make == "BMW":
#             print("The BWM accelerates at a top speed of 120mph")
#         elif self.make == "Ford":
#             print("The Ford accerlates to a top speed of 90mph")
#         else:
#             print("Speed information is not available for this car make.")

# Inheritance is the process of sharing the properties of a parent class to a child class
