# Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to.

# This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene - __enter()__ and __exit()__

#! read()

# # Open the file in read mode

# File handling operations go here

# The file is automatically closed when the block inside 'with' is exited


#! readlines()

# Open the file in read mode

# The file is automatically closed when the block inside 'with' is exited
