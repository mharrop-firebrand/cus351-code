"""
Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
Hints: Use def methodName(self) to define a method."""

"""Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.
Hints: To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class."""

"""Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.
Hints: Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class."""
