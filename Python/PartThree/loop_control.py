#! Loop Control
# Break
# Continue
# Pass

#! Break terminates the loop even if the condition is True


# The while loop is iterating from i = 1 to i = 10
# When i becomes equal to 5, the break statement is encountered
# The loop terminates immediately, without printing 5, 6, ..., 10


#! Continue

# The for loop is iterating from i = 1 to i = 5
# When i is equal to 3, the continue statement is encountered it skips printing 3 and moves to the next iteration, printing the remaining values.


#! Pass


# The loop will iterate three times, and inside the loop, we have a placeholder for a condition that will be implemented later.
# The pass statement ensures that the loop doesn't produce any errors even if the condition is not implemented yet.
