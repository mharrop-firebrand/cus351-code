relationships: ONE TO MANY
-------------------

ERD:
Entity - table is a box
Relationaship - is a line between boxes

ONE TO ONE relationship is a straight line
ONE TO MANY relationship crow's foot on the MANY side
MANY TO MANY relationship crow's feet on BOTH sides 

Primary key:
Primary keys need to be DIFFERENT for EVERY RECORD (row on a table).
In our example the will have the name of the table + 'ID'
The primary key of a table will be DIFFERENT in each row

Foreign Key:
Is a primary key on a different table

A one-to-many relationship ALWAYS goes from 
	ONE on the primary to
	MANY on the foreign key
therefore 
	the table that holds the foreign key is the MANY table in this relationship.
	the table that holds the primary key is the ONE table in this relationship. 


SQL for relationships:

-- one category to many products
-- when you have MORE than ONE table in your query (Categories, Products) 
-- when you are refering to a column, you need to say WHICH TABLE that column is on
-- by using the . notation like this [table_name].[column_name]
SELECT * 
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories
ON Categories.CategoryID = Products.CategoryID  -- Primary key of one table to the foreign key of the other table

SELECT *
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID

SELECT *
FROM Categories
INNER JOIN Products
ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID
WHERE Description LIKE "%sweet%"
