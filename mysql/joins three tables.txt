relationships: MANY TO MANY
-------------------
To implement a MANY-TO-MANY relationship
you make an INTERMEDIATE TABLE - OrderDetails
this table will the foreign keys for both the 2 original tables
Both original tables connect to the INTERMEDIATE TABLE with a 
ONE (original) - TO - MANY (intermediate)

You can say that the Orders and the Products table have a MANY to MANY relationship which is implemented (realised) by OrderProducts


-- SELECT OrderDetails.OrderDetailID, OrderDetails.OrderID, OrderDetails.ProductID, Orders.CustomerID
SELECT *
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN OrderDetails		
ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID 		-- ONE TO MANY from Orders to OrderDetails
INNER JOIN Products			
ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID  -- ONE TO MANY from Products to OrderDetails


-- Robert King has been making a lot of mistakes 
-- and we want to give the customers he has served a Â£10 voucher 
-- to make sure we can keep our customers
SELECT DISTINCT Customers.*			-- DISTINCT - print each line of results just ONCE
									-- Customers.* - get all the columns from Customer
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Employees
ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
WHERE Employees.FirstName="Robert" AND  Employees.LastName="King" -- WHERE after the SELECTs and JOINS
ORDER BY CustomerID		-- ORDER BY should be the last statement
